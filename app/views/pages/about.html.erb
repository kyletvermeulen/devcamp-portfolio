<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>The thing I am intrigued about the most with developing partnerships is beyond just cutting a deal.  It's an opportunity to listen and learn outside of your own comfort zone.  I am a goal-minded individual which has allowed me to manage 15 markets while maintaining 20% year over year revenue growth for my partners.

I am also an avid skier (come find me on top of Mt. Hood), wakeboarder, professed Nintendo fanboy, and strongly prefer DC over Marvel.  Feel free to reach out and discover why I am known by many as the "Man with 1,000 Dad Jokes"</p>
